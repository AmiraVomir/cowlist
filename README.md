# Cowlist
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on independently.

This app allow users to create a cow, and add its description to a database. This app also allows the user to delete a selected cow. 

This app was created using React to interact with a RESTful API powered by Node.js using an Express server and a MySQL/MariaDB database.
